I grew up mostly online, taught myself to build things, and ended up writing software around cryptography, secure data infrastructure, and critical systems where a single error could cost lives.

## Current Work:
- [Tollway](https://github.com/Tollway-QPC/Tollway-QPC) post‑quantum file/data layer (rust + pqc)
- Sketching ideas in supply chain/hardware identity/ot anomaly detection

Focused on problems where integrity, confidentiality, and provenance actually matter: critical data, hardware identity, and operational technology.

## Previously
- Gulfstream Completions Engineering Stress Team (At Gulfstream, helped design and build internal applications, algorithms, and workflows used daily by a few thousand employees across engineering, production, and sales while I was still in a sophmore and junior in high school.) 
- Effingham College & Career Academy - Engineering Pathway
- Aircraft Structure Technology Certification - Savannah Technical College

## Interests
- theology, connecting with god, and living like Christ
- lifting heavy things repeatedly
- reading (classics, math, cryptography, history, philosophy)
- long walks with no headphones
- systems that make life quieter instead of louder
- building software that does something to help solve a problem, not AI vibe-coded slop
- building systems that protect the US and her allies from threats both foreign and domestic
